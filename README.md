# Galaxy-History-Test-Tool

The current progress:

- connect to the galaxy server
- get (visible and undelete) datasets from a history through a user-provided link
- extract the dataset IDs to a list, and then use this list to extract a workflow.
- download the standard workflow of the tutorial through a hard-coded link, and store it as a dictionary.
- Compare the two workflows

- can check:
1. if the tools (steps) in standard workflow/tutorials were carried out.
2. if the parameters are correct (a rough version).

- output a json file containing dictionaries.
