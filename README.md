# Galaxy-History-Test-Tool

A command-line tool to assess user's histories on Galaxy, by comparing the history's corresponding workflow with a standard workflow. 
More general use would be to simply compare two Galaxy histories.
The end result is a json file reporting the differences between two histories/workflows.

Documentation could be find here (underconstruction): https://chensy96.github.io/Galaxy-History-Test-Tool/
