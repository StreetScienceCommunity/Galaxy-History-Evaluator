Welcome to Galaxy History Evaluator's documentation!
====================================================

A command-line tool to assess user's histories on Galaxy, by comparing the history's corresponding workflow with a standard workflow. More general use would be to simply compare two Galaxy histories. The end result is a json file reporting the differences between two histories/workflows.
